Knot Game 2
===

This game was developed as part of my Final Project for my Industrial Design Engineering Degree, with the help and support of Pedro González Manchón.
The Final Project paper (in Spanish) can be found [here](https://oa.upm.es/77063/).

The game uses some functions from the [PyArcKnot Python Package](https://github.com/inigorrix/pyarcknot), which had also been developed as part of the Final Project.
Previously, a [first game](https://github.com/inigorrix/knot_game1) was built as a starting point.
