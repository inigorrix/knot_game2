Knot Game 2
===

This game was developed as part of my Final Project for my Industrial Design Engineering Degree, with the help and support of Pedro González Manchón.
Check out the [Final Project paper](https://oa.upm.es/77063/) (in Spanish) or the [Github page](https://github.com/inigorrix/knots_final_project) with an overview of the project and links to the public code.

The game was built using the [Pygame Library](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) and using some functions from the [PyArcKnot Python Package](https://github.com/inigorrix/pyarcknot), which had also been developed as part of the Final Project.
Previously, a [first game](https://github.com/inigorrix/knot_game1) had been built as a starting point.
